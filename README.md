# 🎲 Dicee - iOS Dice Rolling App

A beautiful and interactive iOS app that simulates rolling two dice with realistic animations and responsive design.

## ✨ Features

- **Random Dice Rolling**: Tap the "Roll" button to generate random dice faces (1-6)
- **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy subtle button press animations and dice rotation effects
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all iPhone screen sizes
- **Auto Layout**: Proper constraints ensure the app looks great in both portrait and landscape
- **Vegas-Style UI**: Clean, modern interface with a green felt background

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Modern iOS development language
- **UIKit**: Apple's UI framework
- **Auto Layout**: Responsive design system
- **Core Animation**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Xcode Interface Builder**: Visual UI design

## 📱 How It Works

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see two dice showing face 1 and the Dicee logo
2. **Tap "Roll"** - The button will animate and both dice will rotate and show random faces
3. **Enjoy** - Each roll generates completely random results, just like real dice!
